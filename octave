{=(r4):**Go DJ, that's my DJ:**\nHow to make/assign DJ role? 
From your server menu, make a role and name it DJ. It doesn't matter where this role sits on your server's hiearchy list, just make sure it's the only role named as such. Once that's done, assign this role to any users (yourself included) to allow Octave to recognize the holder of the new role as the DJ for the sessions in play. This role allows users to skip, jump, and otherwise override the queue of other user request.
â€” 
**A couple of other useful settings might include:**\n`_settings djrole @role`:\nSet any role to the DJrole\n\n`_settings requiredj disable`:\nAllows playback management commands to be used by users without the DJrole.\n\n`_settings djonly enable`:\nDisables commands entirely for any users __without__ the DJrole}
{=(r5):**Managing Access and Settings:**\nOctave comes stocked with ability to make user access limitations within your server as granular as you can dream. 
Follow along the bot prompts to change these settings. 
For example:\nTo make the bot ignore commands in a channel, do `_ignore channel [channel]`\nYou can adjust command OR category usability by user, role, and/or channel}
{=(r6):You can pass these key words `{join(`, `):{opt}}` to view those sections specifically}
